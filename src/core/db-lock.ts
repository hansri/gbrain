/**
 * Generic DB-backed lock primitive.
 *
 * Reuses the gbrain_cycle_locks table (id PK + holder_pid + ttl_expires_at)
 * with a parameterized lock id. Both `gbrain-cycle` (the broad cycle lock)
 * and `gbrain-sync` (performSync's writer lock) live here.
 *
 * Why not pg_advisory_xact_lock: it is session-scoped, and PgBouncer
 * transaction pooling drops session state between calls. This row-based
 * lock survives PgBouncer because it's plain INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE with
 * a TTL fallback (a crashed holder's row times out).
 *
 * Why a separate table-row per lock id rather than reusing the cycle lock:
 * the cycle lock is broader (covers every phase). performSync's write-window
 * is narrower. If performSync reused the cycle lock and the cycle handler
 * called performSync, the inner acquire would deadlock against itself. Two
 * lock ids let callers nest cleanly: cycle holds gbrain-cycle for its run;
 * performSync (called from anywhere — cycle, jobs handler, CLI) takes
 * gbrain-sync just for the write window.
 *
 * v0.22.13 — added in PR #490 to fix CODEX-2 (no cross-process lock for
 * direct sync paths). The cycle path was already protected.

 * cast a bare integer to interval via ::interval (that's a string-only
 * cast). The multiplicative form is the canonical idiom and works on both
 * Postgres + PGLite.
 *
 * Why RETURNING last_refreshed_at: callers print the actual stale age in
 * the per-source verdict so the operator can see "broke lock for source-X
 * (last refresh was 47 min ago)." If we only RETURN id, the caller can't
 * distinguish "broke" from "no-op" without a follow-up query, and we lose
 * the auditable stale-age signal that motivated the break.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   { deleted: true,  lastRefreshedAt: Date } — broke the lock; reports the actual age.
 *   { deleted: false, lastRefreshedAt: null } — refused (lock not stale enough,

 * NOW()` writes. A bare `acquired_at = $3` would therefore NEVER match in
 * production (microsecond stored value ≠ ms-truncated param) — the reaper would

 * lock-holding backend is still responsive — if heartbeat hangs past
 * HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS, abort the operation and release the lock.
 *
 * Lock-id naming convention: `<scope>:<dbname>` (e.g. `gbrain-migrate:postgres`)
 * for multi-tenant safety per cherry D4. Caller composes the dbname.
 *

 *  - lock unavailable → throws LockUnavailableError (caller decides retry)

 *  - heartbeat/renewal fails → invalidate the runtime lease, abort the work
